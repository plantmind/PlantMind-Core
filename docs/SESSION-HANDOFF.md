## Recent Engineering Sequence

- RFC-025 — Core Plugin Framework
- RFC-026 — Bootstrap Public API Consolidation
- RFC-027 — Plugin Lifecycle Integration into Bootstrap
- RFC-028 — Plugin Lifecycle Manager
- RFC-029 — Plugin Infrastructure Composition
- RFC-030 — Controlled Plugin Registration Boundary
- RFC-031 — Plugin Identity Consistency Contract
- RFC-032 — Plugin Metadata Contract
- RFC-033 — Plugin Version Format Contract
- RFC-034 — Bootstrap Startup Failure Atomicity Contract
- RFC-035 — Bootstrap Shutdown Lifecycle Compliance Contract
- RFC-036 — Managed Shutdown Failure Containment Contract

## RFC-036 Outcome

RFC-036 established deterministic best-effort containment for managed shutdown failures.

The implementation:

- Makes `PluginLifecycleManager` continue attempting active plugin deactivation after individual failures.
- Preserves reverse activation order during plugin deactivation.
- Removes successfully deactivated plugins from the active set.
- Keeps plugins whose deactivation fails tracked as active because their final lifecycle state is unresolved.
- Preserves a single plugin deactivation failure as the directly propagated original exception.
- Aggregates multiple plugin deactivation failures through `ExceptionGroup` in deterministic encounter order.
- Makes Bootstrap continue to registered-service shutdown after plugin shutdown failure.
- Makes Bootstrap continue attempting remaining service shutdown operations after individual service failures.
- Preserves deterministic reverse registry enumeration order for service shutdown.
- Transitions Runtime to `FAILED` when any managed shutdown operation fails.
- Keeps Runtime readiness false after failed shutdown.
- Prevents Runtime from transitioning to `STOPPED` after failed managed shutdown.
- Preserves a single Bootstrap-managed shutdown failure as the directly propagated original exception.
- Aggregates multiple managed shutdown failures through `ExceptionGroup` in deterministic encounter order.
- Preserves RFC-035 successful shutdown behavior and RFC-034 startup atomicity behavior.
- Introduces no automatic retry, automatic recovery, dependency graph, parallel shutdown, ServiceState redesign, request-admission implementation, logging architecture redesign or process termination policy.

## RFC-036 Verification

- Compilation: passed
- Focused lifecycle and shutdown-containment tests: 31 passed
- Impacted runtime, bootstrap, plugin lifecycle and composition tests: 64 passed
- Full regression: 225 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Technical commit: `438d7e4`
- Push: verified
- Technical working tree after implementation: clean

## Documentation Closure

The technical implementation of RFC-036 is complete.

The engineering-memory layer has been synchronized with the RFC-036 technical baseline.

Relevant maintained documents:

- `docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/ENGINEERING-JOURNAL.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP-004-Active-Work-Register.md`

## Next Exact Action

Begin architecture review for RFC-037 from the latest committed Git state.

Before selecting or implementing RFC-037:

1. Review the Active Work Register.
2. Review current committed code and tests.
3. Review accepted RFCs, ADRs, architecture documents and deferred work.
4. Preserve established Runtime ownership, Bootstrap orchestration, Service Registry, Plugin Lifecycle, Registry, Metadata, Version Format and Composition responsibilities.
5. Do not introduce automatic shutdown retry, recovery strategy, dependency-aware shutdown, parallel shutdown, ServiceState redesign, process termination policy or structured shutdown telemetry without dedicated architecture review.
6. Record the selected RFC objective and next exact action before implementation begins.

## Required Test Command

```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

## Continuation Rule

Any new engineering session must read the engineering-memory documents and verify the latest committed Git state before proposing or implementing changes.
