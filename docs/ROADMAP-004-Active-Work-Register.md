- Current status
- Completed work
- Remaining work
- Dependencies
- Resume condition
- Next exact action

No item may be marked complete until:

# Active Work

## RFC-049 — Architecture Review

### Status

Ready for architecture review. No RFC-049 contract has been selected.

### Objective

Select the next architecture-controlled PlantMind increment from the RFC-048 authoritative Runtime operational-transition baseline.

### Current Technical Baseline

- Branch: `feature/engineering-platform`
- Last completed RFC: RFC-048 — Runtime Operational Transition Contract
- RFC-048 contract commit: `ac1c625`
- RFC-048 technical commit: `b714ceb`
- Architecture decision: AD-034
- Focused TDD suite: 18 passed
- Impacted regression: 93 passed
- Full regression baseline: 362 passed

### Current Architecture Boundary

PlantMind now has:

- Runtime-owned readiness;
- Runtime-owned request admission;
- correlated operational-workload evidence;
- mandatory-capability coverage evidence;
- immutable external operational-transition evidence;
- authoritative guarded `Runtime.request_operational(...)`;
- atomic fail-closed `READY` to `OPERATIONAL` transition semantics.

Runtime remains the sole lifecycle-transition authority.

A successful operational transition requires:

- Runtime state exactly `READY`;
- request admission enabled;
- complete `OperationalTransitionEvidence`.

No public `mark_operational()` bypass exists.

Bootstrap, Health and workload-execution components do not own operational lifecycle-transition authority.

No automatic operational transition, operational recovery or `DEGRADED` behavior has been introduced.

### Next Exact Action

Review the Source of Truth from the RFC-048 baseline and select the RFC-049 objective before defining any new contract, TDD scope or production implementation.

# Deferred Architecture Work

## PI Connector Package Migration

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

- `backend/app/connectors/pi_connector.py`
- `backend/app/connectors/pi/`

### Future Action

Move the implementation to:

`backend/app/connectors/pi/connector.py`

Retain a backward-compatible wrapper temporarily before removal.

---

## Logging Consolidation

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

- `backend/app/core/logger.py`
- `backend/app/core/logging/logging_provider.py`

### Future Action

Migrate all logging consumers to the logging package, then deprecate the legacy wrapper.

---

## Session Memory Naming Review

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

`backend/app/memory/session_memory.py` is empty.

### Future Action

Define its intended responsibility before deciding whether to rename, merge, implement, or remove it.
