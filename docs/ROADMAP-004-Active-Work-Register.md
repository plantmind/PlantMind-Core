# ROADMAP-004 — Active Work Register

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Status | Active |
| Version | 1.1 |
| Owner | Platform Architecture |
| Purpose | Prevent unfinished work from being lost |

---

# Rule

No RFC may be paused, redirected, or superseded without recording:

- Current status
- Completed work
- Remaining work
- Dependencies
- Resume condition
- Next exact action

No item may be marked complete until:

- Unit tests pass
- Full regression tests pass
- Git commit is verified
- Remote push is verified
- Working tree is clean
- Required engineering documentation is updated

---

# Active Work

## RFC-030 Selection — Architecture Review

### Status

Not started — architecture review required.

### Objective

Select the highest-value architectural RFC after RFC-029 without duplicating existing responsibilities or bypassing accepted platform architecture.

### Current Technical Baseline

- Branch: `feature/engineering-platform`
- Last completed RFC: RFC-029 — Plugin Infrastructure Composition
- Technical baseline commit: `10d6171`
- Full regression baseline: 164 passed

### Dependencies

RFC-029 documentation synchronization must be committed and pushed before RFC-030 selection begins.

### Resume Condition

The RFC-029 documentation synchronization is committed and pushed, the branch is up to date with origin, and the working tree is clean.

### Next Exact Action

If RFC-029 documentation synchronization remains uncommitted, review, commit and push it, then verify a clean working tree.

Otherwise, review current committed code, tests, accepted architecture documents, deferred work, public APIs, lifecycle ownership, dependency injection, registries, plugin infrastructure and Composition Root responsibilities before selecting RFC-030.

No RFC-030 implementation may begin before that architecture review is complete.

# Recently Completed Work

| RFC | Commit | Result |
|---|---|---|
| RFC-021 | `132baca` | Extensible PI tag reader architecture |
| RFC-022 | `0f35b3e` | Generic registry framework |
| RFC-023 | `dbb0a3d` | PI tag reader factory migration to generic registry |
| RFC-024 | `ed9dd63` | Registry public API |
| RFC-025 | `fab2740` | Core plugin framework |
| RFC-026 | `e91a5a7` | Bootstrap public API consolidation |
| RFC-027 | `463e13f` | Plugin lifecycle integration into Bootstrap |
| RFC-028 | `128f129` | Plugin lifecycle manager |
| RFC-029 | `10d6171` | Plugin infrastructure composition |

The previous RFC-021 and RFC-022 active-work entries were stale relative to the committed Git history and are no longer active items.

Any historical task suspected to remain incomplete must be reopened only after current-code, dependency and regression review.

# Deferred Architecture Work

## PI Connector Package Migration

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

- `backend/app/connectors/pi_connector.py`
- `backend/app/connectors/pi/`

### Future Action

Move the implementation to:

`backend/app/connectors/pi/connector.py`

Retain a backward-compatible wrapper temporarily before removal.

---

## Logging Consolidation

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

- `backend/app/core/logger.py`
- `backend/app/core/logging/logging_provider.py`

### Future Action

Migrate all logging consumers to the logging package, then deprecate the legacy wrapper.

---

## Session Memory Naming Review

### Status

Deferred intentionally.

### Current State

`backend/app/memory/session_memory.py` is empty.

### Future Action

Define its intended responsibility before deciding whether to rename, merge, implement, or remove it.

---

# Completion Discipline

At the end of every work session, this register SHALL be updated before starting unrelated work.

The active item at the top of this document SHALL always contain the next exact executable action.
